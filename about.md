About Me
======
I am currently a Professor at School of Computer Science and Technology, [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/). Previously, I was a Research Assistant Professor at [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cse.ust.hk/) of [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk). I completed my Ph.D. study with [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk) under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaowen Chu](https://sites.google.com/view/chuxiaowen) in 2020. I received a B.Eng. degree in software engineering from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn) in 2010, and an M.Sc. degree in computer science from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn) under the supervision of [Prof. Xuan Wang](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/wangxuan) in 2013. My current research focus is distributed machine learning systems.
